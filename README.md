# Tactical Proposals
Competitive analysis and industry proposals. Did this in April-May 2023 and that was before writing a book and using AI. First time I used AI was in September 2023. I made up the formula in bolag.py to determine KPI of industries.

Google Takeout, unselect all, then mark YouTube. awk before (count-1)/4
awk '{print gsub("YouTube",$0)}' mv2.html | awk 'BEGIN{sum=0}{sum=sum+$1}END{print sum}' 
python chunk.py # split file to 1 MB files
cp chunk.py chunk/ # change size to (256 * 256)
cd chunk, python chunk.py # split file to 64 KB files 
python views.py # print the twenty highest titles
```
